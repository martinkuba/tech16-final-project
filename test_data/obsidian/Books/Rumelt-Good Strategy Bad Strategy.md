## Highlights
The core of strategy work is always the same: discovering the critical factors in a situation and designing a way of coordinating and focusing actions to deal with those factors. — location: [164](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=164) ^ref-31749

---
the term “strategy” should mean a cohesive response to an important challenge. — location: [231](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=231) ^ref-2720

---
Strategy is about how an organization will move forward. — location: [242](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=242) ^ref-52291

---
The kernel of a strategy contains three elements: a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent action. — location: [248](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=248) ^ref-12295

---
good strategy has coherence, coordinating actions, policies, and resources so as to accomplish an important end. — location: [289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=289) ^ref-52407

---
good strategy itself is unexpected. — location: [426](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=426) ^ref-30319

---
Having conflicting goals, dedicating resources to unconnected targets, and accommodating incompatible interests are the luxuries of the rich and powerful, but they make for bad strategy. — location: [436](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=436) ^ref-58326

---
Strategy is at least as much about what an organization does not do as it is about what it does. — location: [439](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=439) ^ref-15828

---
the oft-forgotten cost of decentralization is lost coordination across units. — location: [545](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=545) ^ref-37021

Obvious

---
use your relative advantages to impose out-of-proportion costs on the opposition and complicate his problem of competing with you. — location: [594](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=594) ^ref-20835

---
When you cannot define the challenge, you cannot evaluate a strategy or improve it. — location: [621](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=621) ^ref-65220

---
Bad strategy is long on goals and short on policy or action. — location: [697](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=697) ^ref-11755

---
Fluff is superficial restatement of the obvious combined with a generous sprinkling of buzzwords. — location: [702](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=702) ^ref-32536

---
A hallmark of true expertise and insight is making a complex subject understandable. — location: [758](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=758) ^ref-8825

---
A hallmark of mediocrity and bad strategy is unnecessary complexity—a flurry of fluff masking an absence of substance. — location: [759](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=759) ^ref-9191

---
If you fail to identify and analyze the obstacles, you don’t have a strategy. Instead, you have either a stretch goal, a budget, or a list of things you wish would happen. — location: [786](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=786) ^ref-26949

---
It follows from a careful definition of the challenge. It anticipates the real-world difficulties to be overcome. It eschews fluff. It creates policies that concentrate resources and actions on surmounting those difficulties. — location: [820](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=820) ^ref-56419

The job of the leader is also to create the conditions that will make that push effective, to have a strategy worthy of the effort called upon. — location: [891](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=891) ^ref-30494

business competition is not just a battle of strength and wills; it is also a competition over insights and competencies. — location: [909](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=909) ^ref-7242

Importantly, opportunities, challenges, and changes don’t come along in nice annual packages. The need for true strategy work is episodic, not necessarily annual. — location: [930](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=930) ^ref-52196

It is strategy which transforms these vague overall goals into a coherent set of actionable objectives — location: [941](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=941) ^ref-49828

---
Good strategy works by focusing energy and resources on one, or a very few, pivotal objectives whose accomplishment will lead to a cascade of favorable outcomes. — location: [961](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=961) ^ref-34019

---
When a leader characterizes the challenge as underperformance, it sets the stage for bad strategy. Underperformance is a result. The true challenges are the reasons for the underperformance — location: [998](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=998) ^ref-61599

---
bad strategy is the active avoidance of the hard work of crafting a good strategy. — location: [1040](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1040) ^ref-54273

---
Strategy involves focus and, therefore, choice. — location: [1047](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1047) ^ref-45218

Focus implies choice, true

no incentive for anyone to develop and sharpen their arguments in the first place. — location: [1063](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1063) ^ref-17292

There is difficult psychological, political, and organizational work in saying “no” to whole worlds of hopes, dreams, and aspirations. — location: [1104](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1104) ^ref-42292

---
Any coherent strategy pushes resources toward some ends and away from others. These are the inevitable consequences of scarcity and change. — location: [1113](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1113) ^ref-37956

---
Strategies focus resources, energy, and attention on some objectives rather than others. — location: [1126](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1126) ^ref-58709

---
In organizations and politics, the longer a pattern of activity is maintained, the more it becomes entrenched and the more its supporting resource allocations are taken to be entitlements. — location: [1133](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1133) ^ref-46423

---
Leadership inspires and motivates self-sacrifice. — location: [1166](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1166) ^ref-52445

---
Strategy is the craft of figuring out which purposes are both worth pursuing and capable of being accomplished. — location: [1167](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1167) ^ref-34186

I like this - worth it and possible

---
pious statements of the obvious presented as if they were decisive insights. — location: [1201](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1201) ^ref-46542

Most mission statements feel like that

---
by couching strategy in terms of positives—vision, mission, and values—no feelings are hurt. — location: [1204](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1204) ^ref-32244

Interesting, no give or take

general public is either led astray or puts all such pronouncements into the same mental bin as late-night TV advertising. — location: [1239](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1239) ^ref-44669

All analysis starts with the consideration of what may happen, including unwelcome events. — location: [1337](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1337) ^ref-44566

---
Good strategy is coherent action backed up by an argument, an effective mixture of thought and action with a basic underlying structure I call the kernel. — location: [1343](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1343) ^ref-21499

In business, the challenge is usually dealing with change and competition. — location: [1361](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1361) ^ref-21659

---
The core content of a strategy is a diagnosis of the situation at hand, the creation or identification of a guiding policy for dealing with the critical difficulties, and a set of coherent actions — location: [1373](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1373) ^ref-62459

---
A great deal of strategy work is trying to figure out what is going on. Not just deciding what to do, but the more fundamental problem of comprehending the situation. — location: [1382](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1382) ^ref-50689

---
diagnosis is a judgment about the meanings of facts. — location: [1404](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1404) ^ref-19761

---
Good strategy is not just “what” you are trying to do. It is also “why” and “how” you are doing it. — location: [1477](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1477) ^ref-34415

---
good guiding policy tackles the obstacles identified in the diagnosis by creating or drawing upon sources of advantage. — location: [1478](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1478) ^ref-63403

---
the heart of the matter in strategy is usually advantage. — location: [1479](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1479) ^ref-23611

---
in the next eighteen months or everything would collapse. What would you do then?” — location: [1547](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1547) ^ref-14151

Imagine you were under immense pressure, what would you do?

---
strategy is primarily about deciding what is truly important and focusing resources and action on that objective. — location: [1575](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1575) ^ref-17638

Sigh, so many definitions

---
coordination of action provides the most basic source of leverage or advantage — location: [1578](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1578) ^ref-47752

---
Strategic actions that are not coherent are either in conflict with one another or taken in pursuit of unrelated challenges. — location: [1585](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1585) ^ref-34668

---
strategy coordinates action to address a specific challenge. — location: [1598](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1598) ^ref-6595

---
Coordination is costly, because it fights against the gains to specialization, the most basic economies in organized activity. To specialize in something is, roughly speaking, to be left alone to do just that thing and not be bothered with other tasks, interruptions, and other agents’ agendas. As is clear to anyone who has belonged to a coordinating committee, coordination interrupts and de-specializes people. — location: [1628](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1628) ^ref-4552

Not that coordinatiin is bad, but highlighting because of my experience on btowser

---
we should seek coordinated policies only when the gains are very large. — location: [1631](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1631) ^ref-59759

Good strategy and good organization lie in specializing on the right activities and imposing only the essential amount of coordination. — location: [1634](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1634) ^ref-57384

good strategy works by harnessing power and applying it where it will have the greatest effect. — location: [1637](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1637) ^ref-15250

---
Finding such crucial pivot points and concentrating force on them is the secret of strategic leverage. — location: [1658](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1658) ^ref-33597

---
If resources were not limited, there would be no need to select one objective over another. — location: [1741](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1741) ^ref-11649

---
“threshold effect” exists when there is a critical level of effort necessary to affect the system. Levels of effort below this threshold have little payoff. When there are threshold effects, it is prudent to limit objectives to those that can be affected by the resources at the strategist’s disposal. — location: [1744](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1744) ^ref-54944

In other words, focus your resources where it will make a difference

---
That is the power of concentration—of choosing an objective that can be decisively affected by the resources at hand. — location: [1780](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1780) ^ref-58885

---
A proximate objective names a target that the organization can reasonably be expected to hit, even overwhelm. — location: [1791](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1791) ^ref-44708

---
it is not a proximate objective because it is not feasible within the present legal and law-enforcement framework. — location: [1822](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1822) ^ref-58230

An important duty of any leader is to absorb a large part of that complexity and ambiguity, passing on to the organization a simpler problem—one that is solvable. — location: [1863](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1863) ^ref-19351

---
To take responsibility is more than a willingness to accept the blame. It is setting proximate objectives and handing the organization a problem it can actually solve. — location: [1866](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1866) ^ref-28234

As an investor, one wants to find limiting factors that can be fixed, such as paint, rather than factors that cannot be fixed, such as highway noise.

A strategic resource is a kind of property that is fairly long lasting that has been constructed, developed over time, designed, or discovered by a company and that competitors cannot duplicate without suffering a net economic loss. — location: [2244](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=2244) ^ref-7503

Relying on the profits accruing to accumulated resources, they will lose the discipline of tight integration, allowing independent fiefdoms to flourish and adding so many products and projects that integration becomes impossible. — location: [2294](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=2294) ^ref-64707

At the core, strategy is about focus, and most complex organizations don’t focus their resources.

Good hardware and software engineers are both expensive. The big difference lies in the cost of prototyping, upgrading, and, especially, the cost of fixing a mistake.
