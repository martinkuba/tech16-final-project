## Highlights
It is not so important who you are, but what you do. — location: [105](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=105) ^ref-5544

Self control, discipline, hard work etc are more important than IQ or talent

---
self-control and self-discipline have much more to do with our environment than with ourselves — location: [112](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=112) ^ref-8089

---
Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long-and short-term interests. — location: [114](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=114) ^ref-26442

---
If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself; it makes you inflexible. — location: [133](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=133) ^ref-25671

Having a plan is not suitable for open ended processes like research or studying 

---
How do you plan for insight, which, by definition, cannot be anticipated? — location: [138](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=138) ^ref-61578

---
high achievers who have had a taste of the vast amount of knowledge out there are likely to suffer from what psychologists call imposter syndrome, — location: [165](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=165) ^ref-38781

Because they realize how much they do not know, but of all people they actually are

---
it is not just about collecting thoughts, but about making connections and sparking new ideas. — location: [173](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=173) ^ref-53796

Collecting itself us useless, unless for reference, but then you need to know what to look for, so you still need to remember the main idea

---
most distractions do not come so much from our environment, but our own minds. — location: [204](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=204) ^ref-65303

Being able to focus means not being distracted by competing thoughts

---
Notes with a sorted collection of links are, of course, good entry points. — location: [349](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=349) ^ref-25904

---
We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains. — location: [354](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=354) ^ref-21707

---
Everybody is motivated when the finish line is within reach. — location: [362](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=362) ^ref-48500

---
Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have. — location: [386](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=386) ^ref-16331

---
If you want to learn something for the long run, you have to write it down. If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words. — location: [388](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=388) ^ref-8349

---
If we write, it is more likely that we understand what we read and remember what we learn and that our thoughts make sense. — location: [395](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=395) ^ref-5811

---
Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant) and think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests. — location: [409](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=409) ^ref-42604

---
The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions. — location: [411](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=411) ^ref-718

---
Write exactly one note for each idea and write as if you were writing for someone else: Use full sentences, disclose your sources, make references and try to be as precise, clear and brief as possible. — location: [414](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=414) ^ref-21307

---
Otherwise, you must have already known what was in there and wouldn’t have had reason to read it in the first place. — location: [448](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=448) ^ref-30971

In which context will I want to stumble upon it again? — location: [647](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=647) ^ref-10714

---
The slip-box is designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering. — location: [657](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=657) ^ref-34137

---
The collection of good ideas is diluted to insignificance by all the other notes, which are only relevant for a specific project or actually not that good on second sight. — location: [674](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=674) ^ref-17123

---
It is important to understand, though, that underlining sentences or writing comments in the margins are also just fleeting notes and do nothing to elaborate on a text. — location: [695](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=695) ^ref-18311

---
Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from. — location: [701](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=701) ^ref-65000

---
A good indication that a note has been left unprocessed too long is when you no longer understand what you meant or it appears banal. — location: [704](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=704) ^ref-25301

---
The notes are no longer reminders of thoughts or ideas, but contain the actual thought or idea in written form. — location: [718](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=718) ^ref-33508

---
We have to read with a pen in hand, develop ideas on paper and build up an ever-growing pool of externalised thoughts. — location: [762](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=762) ^ref-63167

if we feel constantly stuck in our work, we will become demotivated and much more likely to procrastinate, — location: [818](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=818) ^ref-39011

---
Nothing motivates us more than the experience of becoming better at what we do. — location: [831](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=831) ^ref-44356

---
The ability to express understanding in one’s own words is a fundamental competency for everyone who writes — location: [858](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=858) ^ref-42601

---
the constant interruption of emails and text messages cuts our productivity by about 40% — location: [892](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=892) ^ref-61961

---
Multitasking is not what we think it is. It is not focusing attention on more than one thing at a time. Nobody can do that. When we think we multitask, what we really do is shift our attention quickly between two (or more) things. — location: [917](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=917) ^ref-13426

mere-exposure effect: doing something many times makes us believe we have become good at — location: [922](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=922) ^ref-63660

Some texts need to be read slowly and carefully, while others are only worth skimming. — location: [977](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=977) ^ref-27110

The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame.” — location: [990](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=990) ^ref-25136

Don’t make plans. Become an expert. — location: [998](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=998) ^ref-16200

would never have learned to bicycle if we left the training wheels on. — location: [1006](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1006) ^ref-40359

---
Real experts, Flyvbjerg writes unambiguously, don’t make plans — location: [1050](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1050) ^ref-54633

Meaning they can rely on their intuition which is based on experience

---
it is so much easier to remember things we understand than things we don’t. — location: [1067](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1067) ^ref-56899

---
Things we understand are connected, either through rules, theories, narratives, pure logic, mental models or explanations. — location: [1069](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1069) ^ref-2744

---
The brain doesn’t distinguish between an actual finished task and one that is postponed by taking a note. — location: [1086](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1086) ^ref-55156

---
The secret to having a “mind like water” is to get all the little stuff out of our short-term memory. — location: [1088](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1088) ^ref-15115

---
Zeigarnik effect — location: [1102](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1102) ^ref-48727

Something about letting the mind work in a problem in the background?

---
the mere copying of quotes almost always changes their meaning by stripping them of context, even though the words aren’t changed. — location: [1169](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1169) ^ref-55081

---
students can’t write fast enough to keep up with everything that is said in a lecture, they are forced to focus on the gist of what is being said, not the details. — location: [1208](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1208) ^ref-12708

---
While we should seek out disconfirming arguments and facts that challenge our way of thinking, we are naturally drawn to everything that makes us feel good, which is everything that confirms what we already believe we know. — location: [1220](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1220) ^ref-47840

Information bubble

---
If insight becomes a threat to your academic or writing success, you are doing it wrong. — location: [1248](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1248) ^ref-57165

Ignoring insight because of confirmation bias

---
‘Have the courage to use your own understanding,’ — location: [1293](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1293) ^ref-49834

---
The most important advantage of writing is that it helps us to confront ourselves when we do not understand something as well as we would like to believe. — location: [1327](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1327) ^ref-7502

---
A coach is not there to do the work, but to show us how to use our time and effort in the most effective way. — location: [1357](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1357) ^ref-11982

This is not the argument here but applicable to being a coach or mentor.

---
“The one who does the work does the learning,” — location: [1359](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1359) ^ref-44024

Project based learning?

---
It would also be unexpected to test the students constantly, — location: [1367](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1367) ^ref-55234

Why are there tests now? Why are there grades? It seems testing should rather be a tool for learning instead of testing knowledge and esspecially grading since that creates anxiety and very dijfferrent motivation to approach testing.

---
“If learning is your goal, cramming is an irrational act” — location: [1382](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1382) ^ref-55092

---
exercise reduces stress, which is good, because stress floods our brains with hormones that suppress learning processes (Baram et al. — location: [1385](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1385) ^ref-11203

---
the best-researched and most successful learning method is elaboration. — location: [1388](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1388) ^ref-13293

Make a nite on elaboration

---
Elaboration means nothing other than really thinking about the meaning of what we read, how it could inform different questions and topics and how it could be combined with other knowledge. — location: [1389](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1389) ^ref-17208

---
elaboration works verifiably well for deep understanding, it might not be the best choice if you just want to learn isolated encyclopaedic facts — location: [1391](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1391) ^ref-9445

So perhaps flash cards for learning facts and elaboration for deep understanding

---
Thinking and understanding is what it can’t take off your shoulders, — location: [1394](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1394) ^ref-48162

Slip box cannit do this for you

---
Writing brief accounts on the main ideas of a text instead of collecting quotes. — location: [1417](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1417) ^ref-19357

Likke highlighting vs writing interpretations

---
You could therefore measure your daily productivity by the number of notes written. — location: [1454](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1454) ^ref-4031

Interesting , the number of new thoughts or ideas , plrobablyg harder than it seems

---
Only in the written form can an argument be looked at with a certain distance – literally. We need this distance to think about an argument – otherwise the argument itself would occupy the very mental resources we need for scrutinizing it. — location: [1464](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1464) ^ref-29358

Wow, like self awareness is hard or observing our own thinking

---
The brain, as Kahneman writes, is “a machine for jumping to conclusions” — location: [1472](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1472) ^ref-52410

Brain fills in gaps, it creates narratives from things that are not really related. This is interesting to me because of how information between people spreads e.g. gossip or social media.

---
machine that is designed for jumping to conclusions is not the kind of machine you want to rely on when it comes to facts and rationality — location: [1472](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1472) ^ref-5529

---
A common way to embed an idea into the context of the slip-box is by writing out the reasons of its importance for your own lines of thought. — location: [1493](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1493) ^ref-17797

---
What does this all mean for my own research and the questions I think about in my slip-box? — location: [1503](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1503) ^ref-6955

What kind of notes go in the slip box? Only related to some plroject or everything I think about across all aspects of my life?

---
It would take as long for us to recall a space of time as it took the original time to elapse, — location: [1528](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1528) ^ref-44676

Wow, memory selection actually has a purpose

---
The literature notes are going to be archived, which means the ideas would be lost in the reference system if we didn’t do something with them. That is why we transfer them into our external memory, the slip-box, with which we have an ongoing dialogue and where they can become part of our active set of ideas. — location: [1533](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1533) ^ref-59229

The slip box really is the ideas we want to remember, it's the takeaway that transforms us while the details disappear over time

---
getting the gist of something, the concepts behind the particulars and distinguishing the relevant facts from minor details. — location: [1551](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1551) ^ref-24504

Meaning vs just facts

---
Without a very thorough filter, our brains would constantly be flooded by memories, making it impossible to focus on anything in our surroundings. — location: [1561](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1561) ^ref-64522

---
some random word of the vendor triggered such an enormous amount of associations and memories that he would have to leave the shop, so overwhelming was this experience. — location: [1563](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1563) ^ref-32685

Is this maybe what autistic peopl experience?

---
Remembering is the very mechanism to bring a memory back into our conscious mind. — location: [1567](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1567) ^ref-22303

And here it becomes obvious how important it is to put memories into context

---
it made it almost impossible for him to think in abstract terms. — location: [1572](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1572) ^ref-60569

---
shift the attention from the question of how to prevent information from getting lost or decaying over time to how to keep access to it. — location: [1577](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1577) ^ref-62869

---
What does help for true, useful learning is to connect a piece of information to as many meaningful contexts as possible, — location: [1598](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1598) ^ref-54465

---
making meaningful connections. — location: [1604](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1604) ^ref-61625

what learning is

---
elaboration is nothing more than connecting information to other information in a meaningful way. — location: [1620](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1620) ^ref-54235

---
If you focus your time and energy on understanding, you cannot help but learn. — location: [1636](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1636) ^ref-62166

---
That the slip-box is not sorted by topics is the precondition for actively building connections between notes. — location: [1646](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1646) ^ref-14969

Separating Notes in categories makes it isolated from other information, slip box on the other hand forces us to make connections

---
As an extension of our own memory, the slip-box is the medium we think in, not something we think about. — location: [1687](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1687) ^ref-53429

---
liberating our brains from the task of organizing the notes is the main reason we use the slip-box in the first place. — location: [1697](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1697) ^ref-13365

---
We can provide ourselves with a (temporarily valid) overview over a topic or subtopic just by making another note. — location: [1707](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1707) ^ref-46713

In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note, even if I forget about it? — location: [1713](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1713) ^ref-4152

Add keywords to notes, think about how you will use the note in the future. Instead of subject or discipline as a keyword use something like the name of the problem you are trying to solve or the specific topic you want to write or think about. The key is to not look at the note in isolation, it could relate to many disciplines.

---
making good cross-references is a matter of serious thinking and a crucial part of the development of thoughts. — location: [1744](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1744) ^ref-46407

Having the same thought twice or mistaking another person’s idea with our own is far from unusual. — location: [1790](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1790) ^ref-57668

To be able to see what we see instead of what we expect to see is indeed a skill in itself, not like a character trait of being “open-minded.” — location: [1959](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1959) ^ref-51874

Sometimes, it is more important to rediscover the problems for which we already have a solution than to think solely about the problems that are present to us. — location: [1985](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=1985) ^ref-54822

How you ask the question matters

We check if what we understood from a text is really in the text by having our understanding in written form in front of our eyes. We learn to focus on the gist of an idea by restricting ourselves in terms of space. We can make it a habit to always think about what is missing when we write down our own ideas. And we can practice asking good questions when we sort our notes into the slip-box and connect them with other notes. — location: [2009](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=2009) ^ref-7412

fixation of our educational system to learn things by heart – which means to think without external tools. — location: [2072](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=2072) ^ref-55144

Thinking with what we alreday know and remember vs thinking with the help of external tools?

the brain prioritises ideas that are easily available in the moment. — location: [2075](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=2075) ^ref-40528

Bias, always question your ideas, and yes formulate opinions but have a really good understanding why you have it, articulation ellaboration ability to explain. If you cannot do this then you are susceptible to changing your mind easily

This makesense expexting to come up with an idea on the spot is unrealistic it expects to have perfect access to our memory and ability to make connections on the spot

Every time we make a permanent note, we also make a decision about the aspects of a text we regard as relevant for our longer-term thinking and the development of our ideas. — location: [2091](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=2091) ^ref-18691

Permanent notes are what we perceive as relevant to our thinking

Philosophical, if there is God his consciousness must work very differently than humans. Clearly humans are constrained by our brain, but is tgere thinking without it? What would it be like to know everything al the time, no creativity? No abstract thinkikng?

Organizing the work so we can steer our projects in the most promising direction not only allows us to stay focused for longer, but also to have more fun — location: [2159](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=2159) ^ref-40908

I wonder if this also applies to in general building knowledge, sometimes working on a different topic keeps our motivation to keep working. By working I mean studying and elaborating , making connections etc

Luhmann’s answer to the question of how one person could be so productive was that he never forced himself to do anything and only did what came easily to him. — location: [2184](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=2184) ^ref-45324

I agree but also wonder how it interplays with focus and gial oriented thinking

it doesn’t help when athletes imagine themselves as winners of a race, but it makes a big difference if they imagine all the training that is necessary to be able to win. — location: [2211](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09V5M8FR5&location=2211) ^ref-45105
