## Highlights
Some were inventors, some were negotiators, some were teachers, some were team leaders. — location: [132](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=132) ^ref-19291

Different Strengths

---
teach courses—a form of leadership. — location: [218](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=218) ^ref-13254

---
sit on technical review committees—leadership again. — location: [219](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=219) ^ref-38814

---
wrote papers and books—more leadership. — location: [220](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=220) ^ref-4501

---
isn’t a leader someone who isn’t satisfied with taking the direction set by others? — location: [223](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=223) ^ref-42297

---
Whenever I want to learn about something, I arrange to teach a course on the subject. — location: [227](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=227) ^ref-21998

Do this or at least writing

---
tortured by leadership questions — location: [230](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=230) ^ref-31180

I love these questions 

---
“This word should be ‘87AB0023’, not ‘87AB0022’.” — location: [254](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=254) ^ref-5666

This reminds me of Grady

---
In order to recognize leadership in a group, you must have a model that somehow matches the group’s culture. — location: [264](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=264) ^ref-50329

So true

---
problems arise when we try to apply a model that doesn’t match the situation in front of our eyes. — location: [272](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=272) ^ref-61115

---
Organic models can be contrasted with linear models on several dimensions: the way events are explained, the way a person is defined, the way a relationship is defined, and the attitude toward change. — location: [276](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=276) ^ref-33628

Capture this

---
Linear models get their name from the assumption of a linear relationship between events; that is, one effect stems from one cause, and vice versa. — location: [279](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=279) ^ref-9190

---
Organic models may be characterized by “systems thinking”: the belief that event X is the outcome of hundreds of other factors, including the passage of time. — location: [280](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=280) ^ref-54424

---
The strength of organic models, by contrast, is that they enable us to be comfortable in complex situations that we don’t fully understand. — location: [285](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=285) ^ref-38977

---
In order to use organic models, you must be able to live with the occasional error. — location: [289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=289) ^ref-12857

---
Linear models tend to place individuals in categories. Organic models define people in terms of their uniqueness, that is, their sameness plus their differences. — location: [290](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=290) ^ref-31994

---
see the job of a leader as getting people in touch with their own inner harmony. — location: [296](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=296) ^ref-39442

---
In love, or teaching, or leading, it’s not too useful to think in terms of one person always on top and the other always on the bottom. When we do think this way, we tend to experience emotions of fear, anger, aggression, guilt, and envy toward the other person. — location: [311](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=311) ^ref-9775

In the seed model, Leadership is the process of creating an environment in which people become empowered. — location: [332](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=332) ^ref-63183

---
we can characterize a particular person’s approach to leadership in a specific instance by classifying that person’s actions as motivational, organizational, or innovational. — location: [424](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=424) ^ref-302

---
In order for a leadership style to be effective, there has to be some balance among motivation, organization, and innovation. — location: [429](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=429) ^ref-38632

---
we look more closely at how technical leaders emphasize innovation, we find that they concentrate on three major areas: • understanding the problem • managing the flow of ideas • maintaining quality — location: [438](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=438) ^ref-21894

---
problem-solving leaders have one thing in common: a faith that there’s always a better way. — location: [453](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=453) ^ref-8984

Reading specifications is clearly informational, but encouraging others to do so is leadership by motivation. — location: [501](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=501) ^ref-45656

---
Most prolonged arguments are not over the relative value of the solution, but over different understandings of the problem. — location: [506](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=506) ^ref-41579

---
Complex problems are never understood right from the beginning, — location: [514](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=514) ^ref-5123

Effective leaders build continuous testing of their own understanding into their work. They are self-confident, but realistic about their own intellectual limitations. — location: [517](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=517) ^ref-11645

Too few ideas means no solution at all; too many ideas means chaos. — location: [520](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=520) ^ref-19014

No idea is perfect when it is first formed; — location: [534](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=534) ^ref-32655

---
In the end, projects go faster in an environment where people listen to all ideas, even if the ideas turn out to be inapplicable. — location: [548](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=548) ^ref-23751

---
constant babble of your own unconsidered ideas is an excellent way to discourage other people’s ideas. — location: [565](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=565) ^ref-56284

---
problem-solving leader has a terrific memory and an even better sense of timing. — location: [574](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=574) ^ref-7063

---
test your idea in practice, but to do that, you have to deviate from the strategy you already know how to do so well. — location: [655](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=655) ^ref-56396

---
inefficiency under load is likely to stem from interactions between modules, not from individual modules behaving inefficiently. — location: [759](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=759) ^ref-2228

If you have no particular goal, or if you’re accomplishing what you want to accomplish, don’t try changing your leadership style just because somebody else wants you to. — location: [839](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=839) ^ref-2117

The only way we can see ourselves is through other people. — location: [939](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=939) ^ref-27278

Perhaps it’s the fast pace of the industry, which reduces the likelihood that problem solvers will take time to be aware of what they’re doing. — location: [992](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4VV3I&location=992) ^ref-39918

How do we want to be helped? I don’t want to be helped out of pity. I don’t want to be helped out of selfishness.
