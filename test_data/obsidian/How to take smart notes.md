## Key Takeaways
Always take notes when reading non-fiction text. 

Elaboration is the best method for learning - 
don't just highlight text, but write note in your own words / understanding

Introduction to [[Zettelkasten]]

## Notes

Write all the time in order to help you think and generate ideas / topics to write about over time.

Willpower is a limited resource. Control your environment. And also write all the time, so that the process is enjoyable and does not require willpower.

Starting with a plan actually impairs insight because by definition insight cannot be anticipated.

"by writing, you externalize your thinking process"
take short notes that capture a single idea

### Taking notes
- [[fleeting notes]]
	- ideas, inbox, process later
	- discard after processed
- [[List of Literature Notes]]
	- short, selective, own words
	- what is useful for your writing/thinking, what you don't want to forget
	- reference section
- [[permanent notes]]
	- go through fleeting and literature notes
	- how does it relate to my thinking and existing ideas? contradicts, supports, adds to?
	- link it - either to related note(s) or to an index

Write notes in a way that will help you think and develop ideas. Think about what context you will want to find a particular note in.

Quality of notes matters - the author suggests three types of notes
- fleeting - reminders only, throw away
- permanent - notes in slip box and reference, in context, understandable
- project - archived after a project is finished

Permanent notes should be understandable even if you forgot the context.

Starting with a plan is counterproductive for work that requires insight.

Intuition comes from expertise. Or in other words, expertise feeds intuition.

Taking notes by handwriting makes it easier to remember because it is slower and as result we are forced to rephrase and think about the key ideas (interpret/elaborate on the spot).

We learn by doing ("the one who does the work does the learning"). Coach, on the other hand, should only show how to use our time effectively.

There is this idea that our memory being selective has a real purpose, as it would be impossible to remember everything all the time. And extending this thought ... just as our mind works with remembering the main impressions, taking notes should be selective as well. It should be just enough to remind of the main idea and a link where to go for more details.

Putting notes in folders isolates them from notes in other folders. On the other hand, having notes in the same place makes it possible to make connections across domains. Also, the task of organizing notes is taxing and distracting.
